# Probaverse: Make and Evaluate Realistic Probability Distributions

The probaverse is a suite of R packages providing a grammar for creating and evaluating probability distributions. **distionary** makes distribution objects available and links their representations, and **distplyr** allows for the manipulation of these distributions.

## Status

Univariate distributions are currently accessible via **distionary** and **distplyr**. Updates are being made slowly until funding becomes available. Submission to CRAN will happen after implementing a unified framework defining the distribution object.

## Inspiration

The probaverse gains inspiration from the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) in both naming and philosophy.
